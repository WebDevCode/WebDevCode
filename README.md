- 👋 Hi, I’m @WebDevCode
- 👀 I’m interested in web developement (like that's new), cooking, computers, game development (ooh now we're talking) and much more...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript (for the nth time)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and hopefully will make my contribution to open source soon.
- 📫 I'm reachable via twitter @_tinugeorge
